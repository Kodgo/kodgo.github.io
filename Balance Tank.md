## Abilities
### Spells
A brief rundown on spells, fully talented.
#### Damage Spells

Spell Coefficients-Untalented

- Starfire
The primary spell for Moonkin DPS. Benefits from Curse of Shadows and takes full advantage of Nature’s
Grace. Best scaling of any moonkin DPS spell.
- Wrath
Limited by the global cooldown and extremely mana intensive. 2.4 changes with haste will reduce the GCD
to as low as 1 second, but Nature's Grace procs still do not lower GCDs for subsequent spells.
- Moonfire
High mana usage, but good DPS
- Insect Swarm
Mana efficient, also significantly reduces damage on the tanks. Loses out at high damage levels because of
the lower damage coefficient and inability to crit.
- Hurricane
Helps reduce damage on your tanks (25% slow). Does not stack with Thunderclap or Thunderfury. A
paladin tank should be able to keep things off of you with just a bit of lead. Damage capped as of 2.3
Non-DPS Spells
- Faerie Fire
Typically covered by ferals, unless you have points in Improved Faerie Fire. As many balance druids are
justified a spot because of iFF, this will frequently be part of boss DPS rotations.
- Cyclone
Though now limited to 20 yards, still a useful PvE CC if used intelligently. Subject to Diminishing Returns in
PvE as well as PvP, so not a long-term CC ability.
- Hibernate
Animal CC, quite potent in a limited number of situations. No talentable pushback reduction can catch
players by surprise if they are used to Control of Nature making CC easier.
- Entangling Roots
Outdoors only, but still a nice (and the only literal) root. Chance to break on damage.
Spell Rotations
- IS, SF3
The most Mana-efficient full rank rotation. For further mana savings, downranking to Starfire rank 8 gives
the best efficiency.
- IS MF, SF3
Higher Damage, Higher mana usage.
- MF, SF4+ and variations
Used with the 2pc t6 bonus and/or high levels of spell haste.
- MF, Wrath*8 and MF,IS,Wrath*7
High DPS, high mana consumption. Best for brief encounters, those with pushback [1], and when CoS is
unavailable and not constrained by mana.
- Mash Starfire
Another spell "rotation" acceptable at high levels of haste if debuff slots are scarce. High DPS, reasonably
high mana consumption.
To achieve maximum DPS for a given cycle, you should account for latency in your cast bar. Cast bar mods like
Quartz (see below) will help you do so.
Moonkin Form
•+400% Armor
•Moonkin Aura:
•30 yard range (compared to 40 for ToL/LotP)
•5% Crit.
Nature’s Grace
After you crit a spell, Nature’s Grace reduces the cast time on your next spell (with a casting time--it won’t be
consumed by instants) by .5 seconds. Nature’s Grace does not reduce the GCD on spells. As such it is of limited
use when chain casting Wrath. While your casts may take less than 1.5 seconds, you won’t be able to start another
cast until after the GCD has passed, netting no increase in DPS.
Elune’s Touch
This is the name of the spell that returns mana to a Moonkin on a successful melee hit. While useless most of the
time, if OOM, a Moonkin can equip a feral staff, whack on a mob for a bit, and get back a reasonable amount of
mana. As all spells but Insect Swarm will reset the swing timer, this isn’t something you should plan to do, but if
the alternative is standing there... uh... preening... you might as well. Just watch out for cleaves and stay behind
the boss so you won’t end up parry-gibbing your tank.
Encounters with special Moonkin fun
Moonkin form gives the same +400% armor bonus as does Dire Bear Form. Moonkin can generate large amounts
of threat, and are immune to polymorph spells. This leads to some limited encounters where they make very good
tanks. For 12 seconds per minute, a Moonkin can also have Barkskin up for an additional 20% damage reduction.
High King Maulgar
Shaman tank (ranged, polymorphs his target)
Kael’thalas Sunstrider
Bow tank in phase 2. (ranged, physical damage)
Moonkin tanking?
Occasionally you see people suggest Moonkin main tanks. While Moonkin tanks are certainly possible for a number
of encounters (All of Kara, HKM, and Gruul having been tanked by a Moonkin, to my knowledge), they are hardly
ideal. Moonkin, despite having the same armor bonus as feral druids, aren’t able to dodge while casting, have no
block or parry. They lack the additional HP from HotW. Resilience can relatively easily get a druid to uncrittable.
Talents
Moonkin
The following (impossible!) build includes all of the essential Balance talents.
Balance Fundamentals
It needs one more point in tiers 1/2 to get to tier 3, and two more to get to tier 4. This is usually done with either
3/3 Control of Nature, or some combination of Nature’s Grasp, Control of Nature and Brambles.
•Nature’s GraspExtremely limited PvE utility, primarily as an escape mechanism when soloing.
•Control of NatureUseful in some situations, particularly with short-term CC needs (CCing mind
controlled players can be quite useful.)
•BramblesMuch less powerful than it might seem. Boss attacks happen slowly enough that the additional
threat from Thorns is of minimal use. Paladin AE tanking is the best use, but the gain is still minor and
paladins rarely need help with AOE threat anyhow.
•Celestial FocusConvenient for avoiding pushback when taking damage (the limited tanking done, or
coincidental damage), and the starfire stun is convenient though unreliable for instances like DPSing
Striders on Vashj.
•DreamstateYes, this is actually an optional talent. As of 2.4, most if not all gearing setups will get more
regen from Intensity. If you find yourself mana limited it is obviously an option to get both talents fully.
•Improved Faerie FireOften the main reason a Moonkin is given a raid slot, as no other class has the
ability to reduce, raid-wide, the hit cap for melee. If you don’t have the talent, it is a better idea to let the
ferals apply FF, as it generally is much less of an opportunity loss to them than it is to you (~6% personal
DPS loss). IFF and FFF do not stack [2].
•Force of NatureWhile FoN is decidedly a situational spell, and hardly the strongest of 41 point talents, it
does do reasonable damage if you time them right so they stay alive to do full damage. They can do
upwards of 9,000 damage for a well-geared balance druid if they run their course.
Discussion of FoN usage
Force of Nature is a weak 41 point talent compared to a frost mage's 41 point elemental, for example. That doesn't
mean that it is useless or a waste of points in a PvE build however. The damage they do gives you no additional
threat, so in situations where threat is a concern, they can help there.
The biggest issue with getting the most damage from them is that they are melee, uncontrollable once cast, and
tend to die quickly to AEs such as cleave. Good timing to avoid boss AEs is the biggest thing you can do to help
them. Changes to your stamina and AC also increase theirs, but not enough to matter a bit in your gearing
choices.
One useful and interesting aspect of the trees is that they are subject to many boss RSTS abilities. Having a treant
eat a Toy from Telonicus, for instance, can make them quite useful when timed properly.
Feral
There are no talents of practical PvE use in the Feral tree [3].
Restoration
•Improved Mark of the Wild(While your restoration druids will likely have this covered, it never hurts to
have, and is better than Furor, which you’ll use far less. Spreading out buff duties is always a nice thing to
do.)
•Natural Shapeshifter
You will be called upon to heal occasionally, and you also have to shift out of Moonkin to battle rez and buff
MotW. Significantly reduces the cost of shifting back in when you’re done. With 2pc t5, it is actually more
mana efficient to shift out/regrowth/shift back than simply recasting regrowth. Obviously that is only
relevant if not time-limited, as the additional global cooldowns reduce the heal per second significantly.
•Nature’s Focus
2/5 to get to the third tier, or 5/5 if you skip NSS.
•Naturalist
Probably not the best choice, but if you do cast HT, it makes it much more viable.
•Intensity
Mana. More mana in 2.4. See Dreamstate for further discussion.
•Subtlety
Moonkin can generate a massive amount of threat. Less threat... Good!
Dreamstate
“ Dreamstate Resto” is a reference to a hybrid Balance/Restoration build. With various changes to Lifebloom and
spirit regen throughout TBC it has become much less popular except for low levels of gearing and 5 and 10-man
content, and seeing popularity as well in arenas. In PvE it focuses on Healing Touch for large efficient heals and
high mp5 from Dreamstate. It is less well suited to 25 man raiding where the cast time and size of HT make it less
competitive and more likely to overheal than the equivalent heals from other classes. It maintains some DPS
talents, but not enough to justify a raid DPS slot. Moonkin form is usually taken since you’ve already gone 33
points into balance.
A Typical PvE Dreamstate build
A more HoT-centric Dreamstate
Especially with the changes to spirit regen in 2.4, dreamstate becomes pretty much obsolete as a justifiable
healing build, and already was subpar for damage.
Itemization
Stats
•Very roughly ranked, the spell damage equivalence of various stats:
•Spell Hit: 1.2 until capped
•Damage: 1 (obviously)
•Spell Crit: .6-.8
•Spell haste's value varies drastically depending on spell rotations.
There will be a more detailed article explaining interactions between damage, haste, crit and spell hit, but
until then, very briefly:
Getting hit capped is useful at nearly any level of gear where you would be raiding.
Consider gemming with haste/damage gems after 1077 spell damage, and after 1392 spell damage,
haste.
There isn't (presently) a point where spell crit becomes useful for gemming.
These numbers are for pure Starfire rotations, and a gross oversimplification, so please don't go re-
gemming gear blindly until the actual math sheet goes live. Read up onEfejel's spreadsheet threadfor more
clarification.
• Spell Hit
151/152 rating needed to cap versus raid bosses without an Elemental Shaman. With Totem of Wrath, 113
rating.
SeeSpell Hit
Until capped, spell hit is the best value per point.
•Spell Damage
After hit capping, this is generally what you should focus on the most.
•Spell Haste
Once you reach t6 levels of gear, spell haste begins to be a more desirable stat. Note that while it
increases DPS, it does not increase DPM, so if you are mana-limited, it will be less desirable. With the
introduction of new haste mechanics and gems in 2.4 it opens up new spell rotations and becomes the
most valuable stat, assuming you have the mana to sustain a hasted rotation.
•Spell Crit
Less valuable than direct spell damage but still a useful stat. Don't gem for it, but don't avoid a piece
simply because it has crit.
•Intelligence
Mana
+crit
+damage
+Mp5, doubly so with Dreamstate.
•Spirit
Mana Regen
Innervate
(+damage with Imp. DS)
•Mp5
The most expensive stat, point for point, but in mana-starved situations (no Shadow Priest, no shaman),
valuable for long fights. With access to a shadow priest and shaman, it becomes almost useless. Further
devalued with Spirit regen changes introduced in 2.4.
•Stamina
You do less good to the raid as a corpse. Hopefully. Get enough to survive. How much you need varies
drastically by encounter. If you're surprised by this, I doubt this wiki will do much to help you anyhow.
• Spell Penetration
Essentially useless for PvE. SeeSpell Penetration
Cloth v. Leather
Though obvious, Moonkin can wear both cloth and leather items. Often the ability to wear leather makes druids
feel theyneed towear it. Moonkin used to be pretty much required to use cloth items to get reasonable stats. Now
there are reasonable pieces of leather damage gear. This doesn’t mean that there aren’t better items in cloth,
however. Armor is a stat just like any other. In a typical fight though, you shouldn’t be being hit. Use what best
suits your goals.
Crafted Sets / Items
•LW-Windhawk is reasonable, particularly after the 2.3(?) +heal changes.
•Spellfire is an expensive option just slightly better than many dungeon/quest drops
•Engineering goggles: The base set is better than t4, and the Sunwell upgrade is better than t6, ignoring
any set bonus. A very good piece of gear if you're an engineer, but probably not worth it just for the hat.
•Tier 4: Malorne Regalia
2 piece: Mana return proc. Good for its point of progression, where you are most likely to be mana-
starved.
4 piece: Reduced cooldown on Innervate. Again, nice for limited mana. Still pretty meh.
•Tier 5: Nordrassil Regalia
2 piece: Reduced cost regrowth. Yes, you get to heal sometimes. Might as well use it.
4 piece: +10% damage to Starfire-- Huge. Arguably better than 4pc t6.[4]
•Tier 6: Thunderheart Regalia
2 piece: Longer lasting Moonfire. With the advent of 2.4, it allows more starfires per cast with 4pc t5.
4 piece: +5% Crit to starfire.
•Sunwell non-set
Well-itemized! Woo!
 Idols
• [Ivory Idol of the Moongoddess]
• [Idol of the Avenger]
• [Idol of the Unseen Moon]
• [Idol of the Raven Goddess]
Swapping idols in combat will trigger a GCD. Swapping is possible however during a cast to avoid this. As long as
the idol is equipped as a spell cast finishes, it will apply to that cast[5]. See below for macros.
Given the ease of getting all of the idols, you should have at least the Starfire and Wrath idols. Nothing better
drops from raid content, so get used to them...
Keep in mind that haste will reduce the global cooldown from spells below 1.5s, but an idol swap will continue to
invoke a 1.5s gcd regardless of haste ratings.
Gems
When socketing, only fill sockets to get the bonus if it is worthwhile, be that the socket itself or to fill a meta gem
requirement. When you are filling the socket requirements, though, typically the best bets are:
Red -[Runed Living Ruby]or[Runed Crimson Spinel]
Yellow -[Veiled Noble Topaz]or[Veiled Pyrestone]until hit capped, then
[Reckless Noble Topaz]or[Reckless Pyrestone]
Blue -[Glowing Nightseye]or[Glowing Shadowsong Amethyst], also[Fluorescent Tanzanite]from Heroic Blood
Furnace. If you're at or near the haste breakpoint,[Forceful Seaspray Emerald]is also valid, and usually much more
available.
At some points (math coming soon) haste overtakes damage in DPS, making haste gemming a viable option.
Trinkets
The t5 class trinket,[Living Root of the Wildheart]is junk. 3% Proc rate of 209 damage in Moonkin.
The t6 class trinket,[Ashtongue Talisman of Equilibrium]is useful once you stack enough haste to have the proc up
reliably.
Other trinkets
[Alchemist's Stone]: A very nice trinket now just for the mana regen boost,[Sorcerer's Alchemist Stone]is
extremely strong, particularly for the (lack of) difficulty to attain it.
Non-class/profession trinkets,veryroughly in order of utility:
[The Skull of Gul'dan]
[Hex Shrunken Head]
[Timbal's Focusing Crystal]
[Icon of the Silver Crescent]
[Eye of Magtheridon]
The following trinkets are also good to look into, but vary drastically by situation:
[Darkmoon Card: Crusade]
[The Lightning Capacitor]
[Quagmirran's Eye]
Enchants, descending utility.
•Weapon: +40 damage, Sunfire (50?) +Arcane (and Fire) damage, Spellsurge
•Gloves: +20 dmg, +15 hit
•Wrists: +15 dmg, +4 all stats, 6mp5
•Head: Glyph of Power
•Shoulder: +dmg/crit. Aldor has a slight lead on Scryer.
•Chest: +6 all stats, 15 Spi, 6mp5
•Boots: Boar’s Speed, Vitality
•Back: Subtlety, resists.
•Legs: Runic Spellthread
•Ring, if available to you: +12 dmg, stats
Consumables
•Flask of Blinding Light > Flask of Supreme Power > Elixirs
•Food
+damage, +mp5
•Weapon Oils
+damage, +damage/crit, +mp5
 Notes for Raid Leaders
Classes Benefiting the Moonkin
•Shadow Priest - Mana, Misery
A shadow priest is effectively essential to the viability of a Moonkin for sustained DPS.
•Elemental Shaman - Totem of Wrath, Wrath of Air, Mana Tide, Bloodlust/Heroism
•Warlock - Curse of Shadows
•Enhancement Shaman - Storm Strike
•Retribution Paladins - 3% Crit
Classes Benefiting from Moonkin
•Moonkin Aura
Roughly, in descending order of benefit gained:
Elemental Shaman > Fire Mage > Destruction Warlock > Other Spec Mage > Shadow Priest > Holy Paladin
= Resto Shaman = Holy Priest > Other casters
Moonkin Auras don't normally stack. (Possibly if one has the raven idol equipped and the other doesn't?)
•Improved Faerie Fire
Tanks: Frequently not hit capped. More hit = more threat.
Melee/Hunters/pets: Direct DPS increase, allow for reduced hit on gear. Dual wielding class/specs typically
have the most room to take advantage of this.

Useful Macros
•Idol Swap macros:
As of patch 2.4.3, swapping gear during a cast will interrupt the cast. As such, older starfire/wrath macros will not
work.
If you want to continue swapping idols, do so only after instant casts.
Cast through friendly players:
#showtooltip <damage spell>
/cast [harm] [target=targettarget, harm] <damage spell>
If you're having a hard time remembering to use your activated trinkets, consider adding
/use <trinketname>
(you can add a clear errors frame command here to avoid being spammed with not ready messages)
before the /cast to use it whenever it is up. This isn't ideal unless you also happen to have other timers (drums,
bloodlust/heroism, destruction pots) synced up to trinket usage, but it is better than forgetting to use your trinkets
consistently.
